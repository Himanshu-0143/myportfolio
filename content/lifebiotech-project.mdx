## My First Freelance Project: Life-Biotech

Every developer remembers their first real client project. Mine was **Life-Biotech**—a full-stack website for a pharmaceutical manufacturing brand. It wasn't just another portfolio piece. It was real. It had deadlines, client expectations, and actual users who would depend on it.

This is the story of how I built it, the challenges I faced, and what I learned along the way.

### The Beginning: A Real Problem to Solve

Life-Biotech approached me with a clear problem: they needed an online presence where customers could browse pharmaceutical products, place orders, and make secure payments. They wanted something professional, fast, and reliable.

At first, I was nervous. This wasn't a tutorial project or a college assignment. This was a business that trusted me to deliver something that would represent their brand and handle real transactions.

But I knew I had the skills. I had React, Next.js, and a strong foundation in backend development. So I took a deep breath and said yes.

### Building the Foundation

I started with **Next.js** for the frontend because of its performance, SEO capabilities, and server-side rendering. For a business website, loading speed and discoverability were crucial.

The tech stack I chose:
- **Frontend**: React + Next.js + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL database + Auth + Storage)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with secure email/password authentication
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL for structured product and order data
- **Payment Gateway**: Integrated a secure payment solution for online orders
- **Deployment**: Vercel for fast, global delivery

**Why Supabase?**  
Supabase was a game-changer. Instead of building a custom backend, I got a production-ready PostgreSQL database, built-in authentication, and real-time capabilities out of the box. This allowed me to focus on the business logic and user experience rather than reinventing the wheel.

The design had to be clean, professional, and trustworthy—qualities essential for a pharmaceutical brand. I spent hours refining the UI, making sure every element felt polished.

### The Challenges I Faced

**1. Authentication System**

Building a secure login wasn't just about storing passwords. With **Supabase Auth**, I implemented:
- Secure email/password authentication with automatic password hashing
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data access control
- Role-based access control (admin vs. customer)
- Password recovery and email verification flows
- Session management with secure JWT tokens

What I loved about Supabase Auth was that it handled the complex security aspects automatically—password hashing, token refresh, email verification—while giving me full control over the user experience. I spent time perfecting the authentication flows and testing edge cases. When users could securely sign up, log in, and recover their passwords seamlessly, the satisfaction was unmatched.

**2. Order Management System**

The order creation flow had to be intuitive yet robust:
- Users browse products stored in Supabase
- Add items to cart (persisted in Supabase with user session)
- Fill in delivery details
- Confirm order and proceed to payment

I leveraged Supabase's PostgreSQL database to create relational tables for products, orders, and order items. Using Supabase's real-time subscriptions, I built a dynamic cart system that persisted across sessions and updated instantly. The admin dashboard could track orders in real-time—every new order appeared immediately without refreshing. Every click, every transition had to feel seamless.

**3. Payment Gateway Integration**

This was the most nerve-wracking part. Handling real money meant zero room for error. I integrated a payment gateway, tested it extensively in sandbox mode, and worked closely with the client to ensure compliance with security standards.

When the first test transaction went through successfully, I felt a rush of accomplishment.

**4. Responsive Design**

The website had to work flawlessly on mobile, tablet, and desktop. I used Tailwind CSS's responsive utilities and tested on multiple devices. Every button, every form, every image had to adapt perfectly.

### Deployment and Launch

After weeks of development, testing, and iteration, the moment came: **deployment**.

I deployed the site on **Vercel** and connected it to the custom domain: **[lifebiotech.in](https://lifebiotech.in)**

Watching it go live was surreal. My code, now serving real users. My design, now representing a real business.

---

### What I Learned

This project taught me more than any course ever could:

✅ **Client Communication**: Understanding requirements, managing expectations, and delivering on time  
✅ **Security Matters**: Authentication and payment handling require extreme care  
✅ **Real-World Constraints**: Deadlines, performance optimization, and scalability aren't optional  
✅ **Problem-Solving**: When things break (and they will), you figure it out  
✅ **Confidence**: I can build real products that solve real problems

---

### The Result

Today, Life-Biotech's website is live, serving customers, processing orders, and running smoothly. It's a project I'm genuinely proud of.

But more than that, it proved to me that I'm not just learning to code—I'm learning to **build**.

And that's a feeling worth chasing.
